**Layoffs Data Cleaning Project**
Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a layoffs dataset from various companies, making it ready for further analysis. The main tasks include checking for duplicates, standardizing data formats, handling null values, and removing unnecessary rows or columns to enhance data integrity.

Objectives:
- Ensure the data is free from duplicates.
- Standardize data formatting in specific columns (e.g., removing extra spaces and aligning naming conventions).
- Handle null values to avoid inconsistencies in analysis.
- Remove any rows or columns that do not contribute to the analysis.
